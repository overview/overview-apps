# overview-plugins

The Overview Project is an open source visual document mining system. It was originally designed for investigative journalists, but is now also used for qualitative research, e-discovery, digital humanities, etc.

This repository contains optional plugins that bring new features to [overview-server](https://github.com/overview/overview-server).

# Installation

To be honest, we're not quite there yet. Right now, `overview-plugins` is in too much flux to tie us down to one installation pattern.
