Keyword stack
=============

Displays the most common keywords, and the numbers of documents they apply to.

This is intended as a demo: the simplest plugin that does something useful. It
is all in a single file, `show.html`. Its only dependencies are
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) (both
included in this repository).
